# Print settings

# Because of some visualization difficulties, it is necessary to write diferent
# files for visualization of nodes, faces, edges and volumes tags. Writing
# four vtk files makes the process expensive. So, if you won't need all of
# these files, let us know, setting 1 in the entities whose tags you want to
# visualize and 0 in those that you don't, so we can make the preprocessing
# faster. We hope this is a temporary procedure until we develop our own
# function to solve this problem with the desired efficiency ;)

# Do you want to visualize tags stored in:
nodes: 1
edges: 1
faces: 1
volumes: 1
all entities: 0
