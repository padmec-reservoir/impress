# IMPRESS
**Intuitive Multilevel Preprocessor for Smart Simulation**

IMPRESS is a Python package that implements mesh preprocessing routines for finite difference, element or volume simulation of physical phenomena in general. It uses [PyMOAB](https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab/src/master/) for mesh manipulation and representation adding a simpler interface for its operations.

IMPRESS currently has modules for representation of simple fine meshes and coarse multiscale meshes as well.
