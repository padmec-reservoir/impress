IMPRESS: Intuitive Multilevel Preprocessor for Smart Simulation
===============================================================

The **IMPRESS** is a preprocessor for general purpose capable of handling 2D and 3D meshes. It uses the robustness of `PyMoab <https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab/src/294c7a2825c32926f034da91e7dd58dfc775b060/pymoab/pymoab/?at=master>`_ allied to a simple interface to generate all required mesh entities in a simulation by receiving only coarsening parameters (if necessary) and a mesh file supported by MOAB (see which files are supported in the `Supported Files Formats <https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab/src/master/>`_ session of MOAB description).

IMPRESS is on development phase, but if you'd like to use it, get `instalation <https://impress-padmec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ informations. Next, you can learn how to run it `here <https://impress-padmec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/run.html>`_.
