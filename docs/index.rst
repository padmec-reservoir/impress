IMPRESS: Intuitive Multilevel Preprocessor for Smart Simulation
===============================================================

The IMPRESS is a preprocessor for general purpose capable of handling 2D and 3D meshes. It uses the robustness of PyMoab allied to a simple interface to generate all required mesh entities in a simulation by receiving only coarsening parameters (if necessary) and a .msh or .h5m mesh file.

IMPRESS is on development phase, but if you'd like to use it, get `instalation <https://impress-padmec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ informations. Next, you can learn how to run it `here <https://impress-padmec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/run.html>`_.
